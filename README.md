## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 ðŸ”­  I'm Krishna â€” Data and AI enthusiast currently contributing to the development of [MeridioAI](https://www.meridioai.com/),a conversational AI startup focused on redefining customer engagement in the restaurant industry through smart, chatbot-driven experiences.
 
In parallel, I lead digital transformation initiatives at [Rocket Companies](https://www.rocketcompanies.com), a leading financial services organization, where I apply AI and data-driven strategies to enhance operational efficiency, generate actionable insights, and deliver long-term business value.

ðŸŒ± I recently built a [Multi-Agent AI Framework](https://github.com/krishnamami/Multi_Agent_Anamoly_Detection) for real-time anomaly detection and proactive stakeholder communication, helping mitigate operational risks and potential revenue loss. The framework automates detection and decision routing, making it scalable and adaptable to a range of business-critical use cases.

This work also inspired the development of an AI-driven incident management system tailored for Data Engineers, enabling automated resolution of production failures and resulting in a 30% boost in engineering productivity.
