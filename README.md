## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 ðŸ”­ I'm a Data and AI enthusiast currently contributing to the development of conversational AI restaurant startup, [MeridioAI](https://www.meridioai.com/), which is focused on redefining customer engagement through intelligent chatbot experiences.
 
In parallel, I lead digital transformation initiatives at a financial services company, leveraging AI and data-driven strategies to drive operational efficiency, actionable insights, and long-term business value.

ðŸŒ± I recently built a [Multi-Agent AI Framework](https://github.com/krishnamami/Multi_Agent_Anamoly_Detection) to detect anomalies in real time and proactively communicate with stakeholders, helping minimize operational disruptions and mitigate potential revenue loss.

The system is designed to automate anomaly detection and decision routing, making it scalable and adaptable for various business-critical use cases.

This work also inspired the development of an AI-driven incident management system tailored for Data Engineers, enabling automated resolution of production failures and resulting in a 30% boost in engineering productivity.
